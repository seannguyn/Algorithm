 * 
 * 
 * You are playing a game on an n Ã— n grid of cells. Each cell contains a single
 
integer: the cell in row r, column c contains the integer A[r][c], where

A[1..n][1..n] is a two-dimensional array of integers. You start at the top-left

cell (1, 1) and will move to the bottom-right cell (n, n). At each step, you can

only move to the cell immediately below or to the right. Specifically, from cell

(r, c) you can move to (r + 1, c) or (r, c + 1) only. Your score is equal to the

sum of the integers among all cells you have passed through: you would like

to maximise this score.
